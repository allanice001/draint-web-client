    title: 'Wrapping with glassine paper',
    description: `Wrap the painting in glassine paper or acid-free archival tissue paper.
     Note that any material that comes into contact with the surface of the painting should be archival quality.
     We advise that you avoid touching the paintingâ€™s surface with bare hands by wearing white cotton gloves
     or placing acid-free tissue paper between the work and your fingers when handling.`,

    title: 'Form triangle pockets',
    description: `Take four (4) 20cm x 20cm square pieces of glassine paper or acid-free tissue paper
    (you may adjust the size of the squares to fit the size of your work better)
     and fold each in half diagonally to create a triangle, then fold in half again to create a triangle pocket.
     Place one pocket onto each corner of the painting.
     Alternatively, use cardboard corner protectors but make sure they fit perfectly.
     Otherwise, they can put pressure on the painting and damage it.`,

    step: 3,
    title: 'Fix the pockets by using tape',
    description: `Now it is time to fix the corner protectors you built.
    (This is not needed if you used cardboard corner protectors).
    Add tape alongside the edge of the pocket so you can fix it on the edges of the canvas.
    Never use tape on the front or packside of your painting to protect the fabric from being ripped if the buyer removed the tape without caution.`,

    step: 4,
    title: 'Protect against moisture',
    description: `By using plastic materials that wrap around the whole painting, you can prevent moisture.
    Here you can use plastic sheeting, poly wrap, or, best, a plastic bag.
    If you have, put a salt tap within so moisture can be extracted. Make sure the plastic wrap will stay fixed throughout
    the journey and never touches the painting.
    Finally, seal all edges with tape and again make sure not to use tape on the painting's front side.`,

    step: 5,
    title: 'Wrapping with bubble wrap',
    description: `This will add a security layer to your packaging and prevent damages caused by any hits from outside throughout the journey.
    Make sure every side and edge is sufficiently covered in bubble wrap.
    Try to use big pieces of the bubble wrap to reduce the amount of tape needed to seal all edges that occur. Again, please avoid tape
    from being used on the front side of your canvas.
    Also, make sure the wrap does not put too much pressure on the canvas.`,

    step: 6,
    title: 'Build a cardboard crate',
    description: `The outer layer of your packaging consists of a cardboard crate that is of sufficient thickness.
    It is important that the crate has the perfect size to fit your wrapped painting easily but is not too big for the painting to move inside the crate.
    Paintings sold into a country that is not part of your domestic countries' tax region will need additional paperwork to be included inside the crate.
    Make sure the crate is completely sealed except for one fin. Here the courier will put the paperwork inside the crate. This happens at your door step.
    Please be ready to seal the last fin by having a 30 cm long piece of tape ready.`,
